// Function Scope: Variables declared with var are scoped to the function. They are accessible within the entire function, even before the declaration due to hoisting.

// Block Scope: Variables declared with let and const are scoped to the block they are defined in. They are not accessible outside that block.

// Temporal Dead Zone: Variables declared with let and const cannot be accessed before their declaration within their block.

// in let {block scope}  inner variable can access the outer var but outter can't access the inner varaible.

// in var variable FUNCTIONAL scope u can access both side from outter to inner or inner to outter.
